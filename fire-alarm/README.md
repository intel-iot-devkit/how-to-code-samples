# Fire Alarm

## Introduction

This smart fire alarm application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel-based platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT& M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.
- Invoke the services of the Twilio\* API for sending text messages.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart fire alarm that:<br>
- constantly monitors for unsafe temperature levels.<br>
- issues an audible notification using the buzzer.<br>
- issues a visual notification using the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of fire events, using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert others of a possible fire.

## How it works

This smart fire alarm monitors the ambient temperature using the connected temperature sensor.

If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold (set to 28 degrees Celsius in this example), it sounds an alarm through the buzzer and displays an alert on the LCD.

In addition, it can send a text message to a specified number through Twilio\*, warning the recipient of a possible fire danger.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

In addition to using a compatible platform listed in ![Hardware Compatibility](./../README.md#hardware-compatibility), here is additional hardware you will need to run this example.

This sample can be used with either Grove or DFRobot components.

Grove: 

1. [Grove\* Base Shield V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html)
2. [Grove\* Temperature Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/grovetemp.html)
3. [Grove\* Buzzer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/buzzer.html)
4. [Grove\* RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html)

DFRobot: 

1. [Analog Temperature Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/grovetemp.html)
3. [Buzzer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/buzzer.html)
4. [LCD Keypad Shield](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/sainsmartks.html)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./images/fire-alarm-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Temperature Sensor | A0
Grove\* Buzzer | D5
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./images/fire-alarm-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.
