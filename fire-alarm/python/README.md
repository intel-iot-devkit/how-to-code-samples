# Fire Alarm in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart fire alarm that:<br>
- constantly monitors for unsafe temperature levels.<br>
- issues an audible notification using the buzzer.<br>
- issues a visual notification using the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of fire events, using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert others of a possible fire.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

![](./../../fire-alarm/images/fire-alarm-grove.JPG)

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Temperature Sensor | A0
Grove\* Buzzer | D5
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Temperature Sensor | A3
Buzzer | A2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see [Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the [setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
2. Twilio\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_fire_alarm&subdirectory=fire-alarm/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_fire_alarm/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

### Twilio\* API key (optional)

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

<a href="https://www.twilio.com">https://www.twilio.com</a>

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio\* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

Pass your Twilio\* API key and authentication token to the sample program by modifying the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_fire_alarm/fire-alarm/python/iot_fire_alarm/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28
}
```

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio\* web site as explained above, and then add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the text messages and the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

## Running the program

Once the program is installed and configured as detailed above, you can execute the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_fire_alarm

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```

```

Refer to [How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:
