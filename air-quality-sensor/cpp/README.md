# Air quality sensor in C++

## What it is
Using a compatible Intel-based platforms, this project lets you create an air quality monitor that:

- continuously monitors the air quality for airborne contaminants.
- sounds an audible warning when the air quality is unhealthful.
- stores a record of each time the air quality sensor detects contaminants, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. MRAA https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and UPM https://upm.mraa.io
2. Intel® System Studio ![https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
3. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.

After running the program you should have output similar to:
```
Grove Air Quality Sensor
Heating sensor for 3 minutes…
Please wait, 1 minute(s) passed..
Please wait, 2 minute(s) passed..
Sensor ready!
raw: 	77ppm: 	0.95	Normal Indoor Air
raw: 	40ppm: 	01.15	Fresh Air
raw: 	36ppm: 	0.98	Fresh Air
```
### Running the example with the cloud server (optional)

To run the example with the optional back-end data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the environment variables so it looks like this, except using the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/air-quality; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/air-quality"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"
