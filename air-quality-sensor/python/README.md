# Air Quality Sensor in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform this project lets you create an air quality monitor that:<br>
- continuously checks the air quality for airborne contaminants.<br>
- sounds an audible warning when the air quality is unhealthy.<br>
- stores a record of each time the air quality sensor detects contaminants, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Air Quality Sensor | AO
Grove\* Speaker | D5

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Buzzer | A1
Air Quality Sensor | A3

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see [Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the [setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_air_quality_sensor&subdirectory=air-quality-sensor/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_air_quality_sensor/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_air_quality_sensor/air-quality-sensor/python/iot_air_quality_sensor/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`, and the `THRESHOLD` key set to `50`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` and the `THRESHOLD` key to `500` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "THRESHOLD": 500
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata",
  "THRESHOLD": 50
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "THRESHOLD": 50,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## IoT cloud setup (Optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program

Once the program is installed and configured as detailed above, you can execute the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_air_quality_sensor
    
Refer to [How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

After running the program you should have output similar to:
```
Grove Air Quality Sensor
Heating sensor for 3 minutes…
Please wait, 1 minute(s) passed..
Please wait, 2 minute(s) passed..
Sensor ready!
raw: 	77ppm: 	0.95	Normal Indoor Air
raw: 	40ppm: 	01.15	Fresh Air
raw: 	36ppm: 	0.98	Fresh Air
```
