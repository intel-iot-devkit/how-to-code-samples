## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create an air quality monitor that:<br>
- continuously checks the air quality for airborne contaminants.<br>
- sounds an audible warning when the air quality is unhealthy.<br>
- stores a record of each time the air quality sensor detects contaminants, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Air Quality Sensor | AO
Grove\* Speaker | D5

### DFRobot\*

You need to have a DFRobot\* LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the DFRobot\* LCD Keypad Shield.

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the [project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 
1. Node.js 
2. [MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
3. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
4. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "THRESHOLD": 50
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata",
  "THRESHOLD": 50
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "THRESHOLD" value as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "THRESHOLD": 50,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./air-quality-sensor
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

Refer to [How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

After running the program you should have output similar to:
```
Grove Air Quality Sensor
Heating sensor for 3 minutesâ€¦
Please wait, 1 minute(s) passed..
Please wait, 2 minute(s) passed..
Sensor ready!
raw: 	77ppm: 	0.95	Normal Indoor Air
raw: 	40ppm: 	01.15	Fresh Air
raw: 	36ppm: 	0.98	Fresh Air
```

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:
