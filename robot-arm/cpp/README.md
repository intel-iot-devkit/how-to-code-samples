# Robot arm in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a robot arm that:

- continuously checks the Grove\* Joystick.
- moves two stepper motors, based on the control of the joystick.
- can be accessed via a built-in web interface to control the motors.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to ground (GND) | 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient
2. IntelÂ® System Studio [https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 


## Expected output

```
move 2 1020 
move 1 1020 
move 2 1020 
```
### Controlling the robot arm via a web browser

The robot arm is controlled using a single-page web interface served directly from your board while the sample program is running.<br>
[](./../../images/cpp/robot-arm-web.png)

The web server runs on port `3000`; if your board is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
