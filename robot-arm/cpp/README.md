# Robot arm in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a robot arm that:

- continuously checks the Grove\* Joystick.
- moves two stepper motors, based on the control of the joystick.
- can be accessed via a built-in web interface to control the motors.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to ground (GND) | 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm)
Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient

## Running the program

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ make
    $ build
    $ ./robot-arm

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
