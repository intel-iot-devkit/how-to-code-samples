# Robot Arm in Python*

## What it is
Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a robot arm that:<br>
- continuously checks the Grove\* Joystick.
- moves two stepper motors based on the joystick control.
- can be accessed via the built-in web interface to control the motors.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to ground (GND) | 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the [setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory

You can install the dependencies.

## Python Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_robot_arm&subdirectory=robot-arm/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_robot_arm/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_robot_arm/robot-arm/python/iot_robot_arm/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`.

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata"
}
```

## Running the program 

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_robot_arm

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
move 2 1020 
move 1 1020 
move 2 1020 
```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.
