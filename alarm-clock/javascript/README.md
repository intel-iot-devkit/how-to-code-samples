# Alarm Clock in JavaScript*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart alarm clock that:<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the alarm time.<br>
- displays live weather data on the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of how long it takes you to wake up each morning, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware Requirements

### Grove\*

![](./images/alarm-clock-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Rotary Analog Sensor | A0
Grove Button | D4
Grove Buzzer | D5
Grove RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

![](./images/alarm-clock-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Buzzer | A1
Button | A2
Rotary Analog Sensor | A3

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the [project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 
1. Node.js 
2. [MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
3. Weather Underground\* API key (optional)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional real-time weather data, obtain a key from the Weather Underground\* website as documented above, and then change the `WEATHER_API_KEY` and `LOCATION` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the weather data, as well as either the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM\ Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `LOCATION`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Weather Underground\* API key

To optionally fetch the real-time weather information, you need to get an API key from the Weather Underground\* website:

<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api</a>

You cannot retrieve weather conditions without obtaining a Weather Underground\* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the weather data.

Pass your Weather Underground\* API key to the sample program by modifying the `WEATHER_API_KEY` key in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  WEATHER_API_KEY: "YOURAPIKEY"
}
```
## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./alarm-clock
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
[Upload Complete] forecast: Clear
Alarm duration (ms): 3256
Connecting to MQTT server...
MQTT message published: { d: {value: '3256'} }
```

Refer to [How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:
