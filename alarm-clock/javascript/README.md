# Alarm clock in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart alarm clock application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.)
 board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.
- Invoke the services of the Weather Underground\* API for accessing weather data.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a smart alarm clock that:<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the alarm time.<br>
- displays live weather data on the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of how long it takes you to wake up each morning, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart alarm clock has a number of useful features. Set the alarm using a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway using your mobile phone. When the alarm goes off, the buzzer sounds and the LCD indicates it’s time to get up. The rotary dial can be used to adjust the brightness of the display.

In addition, the smart alarm clock can access daily weather data via the Weather Underground\* API and use it to change the color of the LCD.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

### Manual Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js\* modules needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison board, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

You must install the Intel® XDK on the Intel® IoT Gateway, by following the directions on the above link, under the section "Connecting to the Intel® XDK".

The Arduino 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manully on to your Arduino 101.

You will also need to configure the `config.json` in the example to use the Arduino 101. See the section "Configuring the example" below.

### Weather Underground\* API key

To optionally fetch the real-time weather information, you need to get an API key from the Weather Underground\* website:

<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api</a>

You cannot retrieve weather conditions without obtaining a Weather Underground\* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the weather data.

Pass your Weather Underground\* API key to the sample program by modifying the `WEATHER_API_KEY` key in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  WEATHER_API_KEY: "YOURAPIKEY"
}
```

### IoT cloud setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional real-time weather data, obtain a key from the Weather Underground\* website as documented above, and then change the `WEATHER_API_KEY` and `LOCATION` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the weather data, as well as either the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM\ Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `LOCATION`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

![](./../../images/js/alarm-clock-output.png)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on the Intel® Edison board, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Setting the alarm

![](./../../images/js/alarm-clock-web.png)

The alarm is set using a single-page web interface served directly from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

### Determining the Intel® Edison board IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see the output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
