# Color match game in Java*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a color match game.<br>
- a UI of the game is exposed through an embedded server, providing with buttons for color matching as well as a "start game" button<br>
- when starting the game, for each level a sequence of colors is displayed on the RGB LCD screen of the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board. The player needs to click on the corresponding buttons on the website.
- for each level the sequence has one more color.<br>
- when a user clicks a color, the same color is displayed on the RGB LCD screen.<br>

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. ![Intel® System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-java)
2. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 

## Configuring the example
Clone the How-To Code Samples repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

$ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git
To download a .zip file, in your web browser go to https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples and click the Download ZIP button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Set up the source files
You now need to copy the source files and the config file to the project.
Drag all of the files from your git repository's "src" folder into the new project's src folder in Intel® System Studio. Make sure previously auto-generated main class is overridden.

The project uses the following external jars: [jetty-all-9.3.7.v20160115-uber](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/9.3.7.v20160115/jetty-all-9.3.7.v20160115-uber.jar). These can be found in the Maven Central Repository. Create a "jars" folder in the project's root directory, and copy all needed jars in this folder.
In Intel® System Studio, select all jar files in "jars" folder and  right click -> Build path -> Add to build path

Now you need to add the UPM jar files relevant to this specific sample.
right click on the project's root -> Build path -> Configure build path. Java Build Path -> 'Libraries' tab -> click on "add external JARs..."

for this sample you will need the following jars:

1. upm_i2clcd.jar

The jars can be found at the IOT Devkit installation root path\iss-iot-win\devkit-x86\sysroots\i586-poky-linux\usr\lib\java

## Preparing your target platform before running the project

In order for the sample to run you will need to copy some files to your board. This can be done using SCP through SSH.<br>
Two sorts of files need to be copied from the sample repository:

1. Jar files- external libraries in the project need to be copied to "/usr/lib/java"
2. web files- files within site_contents folder need to be copied to "/var/AlarmClock"

## Accessing the game

![](./../../images/java/color-match-game-web.JPG)

The color match game is set using a single-page web interface served from your board while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `8080`, so if your board is connected to Wi-Fi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:8080/home`.


## Regenerating the HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
We have a useful tutorial on how to use the shell script here:

[how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](./../../docs/cpp/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)


### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:
