# Color match game in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a color match game.<br>
- a UI of the game is exposed through an embedded server, providing with buttons for color matching as well as a "start game" button<br>
- when starting the game, for each level a sequence of colors is displayed on the RGB LCD screen of the Intel-based platform. The player needs to click on the corresponding buttons on the website.
- for each level the sequence has one more color.<br>
- when a user clicks a color, the same color is displayed on the RGB LCD screen.<br>

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Grove RGB LCD | I2C

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
2. Intel® System Studio ![https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient

### Accessing the game

![](./../../images/java/color-match-game-web.JPG)

The color match game is set using a single-page web interface served from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway are connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000/`.

## Regenerating the HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
We have a useful tutorial on how to use the shell script here:
