# Color Match Game in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a color match game.<br>
- a UI of the game is exposed through an embedded server, providing with buttons for color matching as well as a "start game" button<br>
- when starting the game, for each level a sequence of colors is displayed on the RGB LCD screen of the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.). The player needs to click on the corresponding buttons on the website.
- for each level the sequence has one more color.<br>
- when a user clicks a color, the same color is displayed on the RGB LCD screen.<br>
- different tones are played when user clicks on color buttons.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove RGB LCD | I2C

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or Amazon Web Services (AWS)\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_color_match_game&subdirectory=color-match-game/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_color_match_game/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

### Running the program 

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_color_match_game

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.
