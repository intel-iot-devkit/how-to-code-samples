## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a color match game.<br>
- a UI of the game is exposed through an embedded server, providing with buttons for color matching as well as a "start game" button<br>
- when starting the game, for each level a sequence of colors is displayed on the RGB LCD screen of the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board. The player needs to click on the corresponding buttons on the website.
- for each level the sequence has one more color.<br>
- when a user clicks a color, the same color is displayed on the RGB LCD screen.<br>
- different tones are played when user clicks on color buttons.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

![](./../../color-match-game/images/color-match-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 
1. Node.js 
2. [MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Intel® Edison board, just leave the `platform` key in the `config.json` set to `edison`.

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.), change the `platform` key to the value `firmata` in the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```
## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./color-match-game

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.
