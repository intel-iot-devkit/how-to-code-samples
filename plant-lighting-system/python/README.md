# Plant Lighting System in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create an automatic plant lighting monitor system that:<br>
- uses a light sensor to determine if a separate automated lighting system is turned on or off based on a configurable schedule.<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the lighting times.<br>
- monitors the water levels using a connected moisture sensor.<br>
- logs events from the lighting system using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert recipients if the system if not working as expected.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Light Sensor | A0
Grove\* Moisture Sensor | A1
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Ambient Light Sensor | A1
Moisture Sensor | A2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
2. Twilio\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

### Twilio\* API key (optional)

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

[https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_plant_lighting_system/plant-lighting-system/python/iot_plant_lighting_system/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.), add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio\* web site as explained above, and then add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for both the text messages and the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN",
  "SERVER": "http://Intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/lighting-system",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_plant_lighting_system
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 'off 2016-04-22T03:39:36.101Z' } } 
SMS sent { sid: 'SM14faee6a517f44db91d985c9ee68b3b2', 
	date_created: 'Fri, 22 Apr 2016 03:39:36 +0000', 
	date_updated: 'Fri, 22 Apr 2016 03:39:36 +0000', 
	date_sent: null, 
```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:
