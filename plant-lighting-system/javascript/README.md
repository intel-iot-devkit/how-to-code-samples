## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create an automatic plant lighting monitor system that:<br>
- uses a light sensor to determine if a separate automated lighting system is turned on or off based on a configurable schedule.<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the lighting times.<br>
- monitors the water levels using a connected moisture sensor.<br>
- logs events from the lighting system using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert recipients if the system if not working as expected.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Light Sensor | A0
Grove\* Moisture Sensor | A1
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Ambient Light Sensor | A1
Moisture Sensor | A2

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

### Setting the lighting schedule

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) 
1. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
3. Twilio\* account (optional)

### Twilio\* API key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

<a href="https://www.twilio.com">https://www.twilio.com</a>

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio\* web site as explained above, and then add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://Intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/lighting-system",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the text messages and the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN",
  "SERVER": "http://Intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/lighting-system",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./plant-lighting-system
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 'off 2016-04-22T03:39:36.101Z' } }

	date_created: 'Fri, 22 Apr 2016 03:39:36 +0000', 
	date_updated: 'Fri, 22 Apr 2016 03:39:36 +0000', 
	date_sent: null,

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Datastore server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.
