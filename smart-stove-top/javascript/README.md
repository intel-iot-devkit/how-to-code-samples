# Smart stove top in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart stove top application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Set up a web application server to set the target temperature and store this data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft\* Azure\*, IoT from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.


## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart stove top that:<br>
- allows you to set a target temperature.<br>
- monitors your stove and notifies you when your set temperature is reached.<br>
- stores historical temperature data using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart stove top sensor has a number of useful features designed to help you monitor the temperature of the food you are cooking on your legacy stove top.
Set the target temperature for a pot on your range top via a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board, using your mobile phone.

When the target temperature is reached, the speaker issues an audible notification. If an open flame from a pot boiling over is detected, alarm goes off.

Optionally, all data can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS account.

### Manual Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js\* modules needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison bpard, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284

You must install the Intel® XDK on the Intel® IoT Gateway, by following the directions on the above link, under the section "Connecting to the Intel® XDK".

The Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manully on to your Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

You will also need to configure the `config.json` in the example to use the Arduino\/Genuino\* 101. See the section "Configuring the example" below.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

The DFRobot\* variation of this example does not yet support the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file after the required `TARGET_TEMP` key as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/smart-stovetop",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/blob/master/js-mqtt.md](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/blob/master/js-mqtt.md)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on the Intel® Edison board, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Setting the temperature

![](./../../images/js/smart-stove-web.png)

The target temperature is set using a single-page web interface served from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`; if the Intel® Edison board is connected to WiFi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

### Determining the Intel® Edison board's IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
