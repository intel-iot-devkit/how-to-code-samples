# Smart Stove Top in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart stove top that:<br>
- allows you to set a target temperature.<br>
- monitors your stove and notifies you when your set temperature is reached.<br>
- stores historical temperature data using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* IR Temperature Sensor | A0
Grove\* Flame Sensor | D4
Grove\* Speaker | D5

### DFRobot\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Temperature Sensor | A3
Buzzer | A1
Flame Sensor | A2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_smart_stove_top/smart-stove-top/python/iot_smart_stove_top/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```


## Running the program

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_smart_stove_top

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```

Connecting to MQTT server... 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 104.1676025390625 } } 
```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.
