# Smart stove top in C++

## Introduction

This smart stove top application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Intel® Arduino/Genuino 101 board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to set the temperature and store this temperature data using Azure\* Redis Cache from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a smart stove top that:

- monitors the temperature using the sensor and gives an audible notification when your food reaches the desired temperature and you need to turn down the heat.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via a built-in web interface to set the desired temperature.
- monitors for a possible fire, by using the attached flame sensor, and gives an urgent audible warning.
- keeps track of the cooking temperature using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart stove top sensor has a number of useful features designed to help you monitor the temperature of the food you are cooking on your legacy stove top.

You can set the target temperature for a pot on your range top using a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, using your mobile phone.

When the target temperature is reached, the speaker gives an audible notification. If an open flame from a pot boiling over is detected, an alarm sounds.

Optionally, the smart stove top sensor can store events using the Intel® IoT Examples Data store or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS account.

![](./../../images/cpp/path-symbol-rebuild-ok.png)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System 

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional back-end data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables so it looks like this, except using the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/smart-stovetop;export API_KEY="YOURKEY"; export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/counter/logger/smart-stove"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board  or Intel® IoT Gateway

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System .<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284

The Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow* web server.

[how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](./../../docs/cpp/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)

### Setting the temperature

The target temperature is set using a single-page web interface served up from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/smrt-rng-app.png)

The web server runs on port `3000`; if the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway is connected to WiFi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
