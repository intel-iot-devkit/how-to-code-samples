# Watering System in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create an automatic watering system that:<br>
- turns a water pump on or off based on a configurable schedule.<br>
- detects if the pumping occurs when expected, by using a water flow sensor.<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the watering times;<br>
- keeps track of watering events, using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert recipients if the system is not working as expected.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements


### Grove\* Environment & Agriculture Kit, containing:

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay | D4
One wire from the pump | 5V power source
Other wire from pump | One of the Power connectors on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board
Other power connector  on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board | 5V power source reserved for the pump
Water Flow Sensor | Red wire into the 5V pin, the black wire into the GND pin, and the yellow wire into digital pin 2
Grove\* Moisture Sensor | A0

### DFRobot\* Starter Kit for Intel® Edison, containing:

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Relay Module | A1
One wire from the pump | GND of the power source
Other wire from the pump | NC (Normally Closed) connector on the Relay Module
COM (Common) connector | + of the 5V power source
Moisture Sensor | A3

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
2. Twilio\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_watering_system&subdirectory=watering-system/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_watering_system/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Twilio\* API key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* web site:

<a href="https://www.twilio.com">https://www.twilio.com</a>

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio\* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

Pass your Twilio\* API key and authentication token to the sample program by modifying the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_watering_system/watering-system/python/iot_watering_system/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\*(branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio\* website as explained above, and then change the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program manually

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_watering_system

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
moisture (46) 
Connecting to MQTT server... 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 'moisture (46) 2016-04-22705:14:56.681Z' } } 
```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.
