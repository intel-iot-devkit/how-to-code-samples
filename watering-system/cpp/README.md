# Watering system in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create an automatic watering system that:

- turns a water pump on and off based on a configurable schedule.
- detects if the watering system is pumping when expected, by using a water flow sensor.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via a built-in web interface to set the watering intervals.
- keeps track of the watering system, using cloud-based data storage.
- sends text messages to alert the user if the system if not working as expected.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay | D4
One wire from the pump | 5V power source
Other wire from pump | One of the Power connectors on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board
Other power connector  on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board | 5V power source reserved for the pump
Water Flow Sensor | Red wire into the 5V pin, the black wire into the GND pin, and the yellow wire into digital pin 2
Grove\* Moisture Sensor | A0

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Relay Module | A1
One wire from the pump | GND of the power source
Other wire from the pump | NC (Normally Closed) connector on the Relay Module
COM (Common) connector | + of the 5V power source
Moisture Sensor | A3

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
2. [Intel速 System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
3. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
4. Twilio\* account (optional)

Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient

### Twilio\* API Key (optional)

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

[https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

You can still run the example, but without a Twilio API key you cannot send SMS alerts.

## Expected output
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
UPLOADING: Uploading project bundle to IoT device. 
[Upload Complete] moisture (46) 
Connecting to MQTT server... 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 'moisture (46) 2016-04-22705:14:56.681Z' } } 
```
## Setting the watering schedule

The schedule for the watering system is set using a single-page web interface served up from the Intel速 Edison board or Intel速 IoT Gateway while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/water-sys-app.png)

The latest data values from the connected Grove\* Moisture Sensor are displayed at the bottom of the web page.

The web server runs on port `3000`; if the your board is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## Running the example with the cloud server (optional)

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel速 System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **watering-system**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/watering-system; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/watering-system"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"; export TWILIO_SID="Enter Twilio SID Here"; export TWILIO_TOKEN="Enter Twilio Token Here"; export TWILIO_TO="Enter Number to Send to here Formattted 555-555-5555"; export TWILIO_FROM="Enter Number to be Sent From Here Formated 555-555-5555"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from your board.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
