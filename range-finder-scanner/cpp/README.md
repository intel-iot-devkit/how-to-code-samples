# Range finder scanner in C++

## What It Is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a range finding scanner that:

- continuously checks the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter.
- moves the stepper motor in a 360-degree circle.
- can be accessed via a built-in web interface to view range finder data.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Controller to ground (GND) | 5V (VCC) and 5V (VM)

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
2. [Intel® System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 

*Note*: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code:
- jsoncpp 
- restclient

### Expected output
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
296 false
297 false
298 false
299 false 
```

Range data is viewed using a single-page web interface served directly from your board while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/js/range-finder-web.png)

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if your board is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
