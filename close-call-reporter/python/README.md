# Close Call Reporter in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a close call fleet driving reporter that:<br>
- monitors the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter.<br>
- monitors the Grove\* GPS.<br>
- keeps track of close calls and logs them using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

![](./../../close-call-reporter/images/close-call-grove.JPG)

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter | D2
Grove\* GPS | UART port

### DFRobot\* 

![](./../../close-call-reporter/images/close-call-dfrobot.JPG)

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
IR Distance Sensor | D4
GPS cable TX (white) | RX pin
GPS cable RX (black) | TX pin
GPS cable power (red) | 5V pins
GPS cable ground (thicker black) | GND

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_close_call_reporter&subdirectory=close-call-reporter/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_close_call_reporter/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_close_call_reporter/close-call-reporter/python/iot_close_call_reporter/config.json`.

To configure the GPS hardware for the example set the `GPS_BAUD` config key in `config.json` to the UART baud rate used by your specific GPS device. The `GPS_BAUD` config value is set to `9600` by default.

```JSON
{
    "kit": "grove",
    "GPS_BAUD": 9600
}
```

The table below contains the GPS baud rates for the common GPS hardware used with this example:

| GPS Hardware                   | UART Baud Rate |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Grove GPS                      | 9600           |
| DFRobot GPS Receiver (Model A) | 38400          |
| DFRobot GPS Receiver (Model B) | 115200         |

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program

Once the program is installed and configured as detailed above, you can execute the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_close_call_reporter
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
close call at $GPGGA,022655.000,3405.0861,N,11816.6856,W,2,8,1.07,154.4,M,-33.6,M,0000,0000*65

} }
```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:
