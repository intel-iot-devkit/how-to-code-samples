# Close call reporter in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a close-call fleet driving reporter that:

- monitors the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter;
- monitors the Grove\* GPS;
- keeps track of close calls and logs them using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
IR Distance Sensor | D4
GPS cable TX (white) | RX pin
GPS cable RX (black) | TX pin
GPS cable power (red) | 5V pins
GPS cable ground (thicker black) | GND

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
2. Intel® System Studio ![https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
3. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
close call at $GPGGA,022655.000,3405.0861,N,11816.6856,W,2,8,1.07,154.4,M,-33.6,M,0000,0000*65
Connecting to MQTT server...
MQTT message published: { d: { value: '2016-04-22T02:26:56.373Z $GPGGA,022655.000,3405.0861,N,11816.6856,W,2,8,1.07,154.4,M,-33.6,M,0000,0000*65\r'
} }
```

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

### Running the example with the cloud server (optional)

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **close-call**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/close-call;export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/close-call"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from your board.
