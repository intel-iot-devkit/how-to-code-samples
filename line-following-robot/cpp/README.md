# Line following robot in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a line-following robot that:

- continuously checks the line finder sensor.
- moves forward if on the line, using stepper motors.
- tries to pivot to find the line if not on it, using stepper motors.
- logs events from the line finder sensor, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to Ground (GND) | 5V power (VCC), and 5V power (VM)
Grove\* Line Finder | D2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
2. [Intel® System Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
3. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

*Note*: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code 
- jsoncpp 
- restclient

## Expected output

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
{ value: '2016-04-22T03:28:35.962Z' } 
Connecting to MQTT server... 
moving forward 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: '2016-04-22T03:28:35.962Z' } }

```

## Running the example with the cloud server (optional)

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/line-follower; export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/line-follower"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from your board.
