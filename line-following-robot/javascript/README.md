# Line Following Robot in JavaScript*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a line following robot that:<br>
- continuously checks the line finder sensor.<br>
- moves forward if on the line, using the stepper motors.<br>
- tries to pivot to find the line if not on it, using the stepper motors.<br>
- logs events from the line finder sensor, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

You need to power the Intel-based platform with the external power adapter that comes with your starter kit, or substitute it with an external 12V 1.5A power supply. You can also use an external battery, such as a 5V USB battery.

In addition, you need a breadboard and an extra 5V power supply to provide power to both motors. Note: you need a separate battery or power supply for the motors. You cannot use the same power supply for both the Intel-based platform and the motors, so you need either 2 batteries or 2 power supplies in total.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to Ground (GND) | 5V power (VCC), and 5V power (VM)
Grove\* Line Finder | D2

Look at the bottom of the shield to determine the pin numbers.

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 
1. Node.js\* 
2. [MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Intel-based platform, just leave the `platform` key in the `config.json` set to `edison`. To configure the example for the Intel速 IoT Gateway, change the `platform` key in the `config.json` to `firmata` as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "firmata",
  "CLOCKWISE": 1,
  "WHITE_LINES": 0
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "edison",
  "CLOCKWISE": 1,
  "WHITE_LINES": 0,
  "SERVER": "http://Intel速-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/line-follower",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./line-following-robot
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
{ value: '2016-04-22T03:28:35.962Z' }

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### MQTT server setup (optional)

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:
