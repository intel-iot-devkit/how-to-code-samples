# Equipment Activity Monitor in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a shop-floor equipment activity monitor that:<br>
- tracks equipment usage by monitoring sound and vibration sensors.<br>
- issues a visual notification whenever the equipment is in use.<br>
- logs equipment usage using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

![](./../../equipment-activity-monitor/images/equipment-activity-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Sound Sensor | A0
Grove\* Piezo Vibration Sensor | A2
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

![](./../../equipment-activity-monitor/images/equipment-activity-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Sound Sensor | A1
Digital Vibration Sensor | A2

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/)  
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
4. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies 

### Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

### Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_equipment_activity_monitor&subdirectory=equipment-activity-monitor/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_equipment_activity_monitor/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_equipment_activity_monitor/equipment-activity-monitor/python/iot_equipment_activity_monitor/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "VIBRATION_THRESHOLD": 100,
  "NOISE_THRESHOLD": 0
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata",
  "VIBRATION_THRESHOLD": 100,
  "NOISE_THRESHOLD": 0
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "VIBRATION_THRESHOLD": 100,
  "NOISE_THRESHOLD": 0,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

## Running the program

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_equipment_activity_monitor

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
Noise level: 305
Value: start 2016-04-22T02:54:15.946Z 
Connecting to MQTT server... 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: 'start 2016-04-22T02:54:15.951Z' } }
Vibration: 48 
```
The LCD should now display `ready`.<br>
