# Earthquake detector in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create an earthquake detector that:

- senses motion using a digital accelerometer.
- checks live earthquake data, using the USGS API.
- displays an earthquake warning on the LCD.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer | I2C
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
One end of a DFRobot\* cable into the plug labeled "X" on the Triple-Axis Accelerometer | A1
One end of a DFRobot\* cable into the plug labeled "Y" on the Triple-Axis Accelerometer | A2
One end of a DFRobot\* cable into the plug labeled "Z" on the Triple-Axis Accelerometer | A3

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io)
Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient
2. IntelÂ® System Studio ![https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.

3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.

5. Your new name symbol and value will now be displayed. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/name-var-ok.png)
6. Another dialog box will appear asking to rebuild project. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/path-symbol-rebuild-ok.png)

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```
Checking... 
No quake. 
```

When the the program loads correctly, your Grove\* RGB LCD shows the `quakebot ready` message.<br>

If you shake the accelerometer, the detector checks to see if there really was an earthquake.
