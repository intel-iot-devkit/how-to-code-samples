# Doorbell in JavaScript*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart doorbell that:
- issues an audible notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- issues a visual notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- keeps track of visitors using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries. You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

![](./../../doorbell/images/doorbell-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Touch Sensor | D4 
Grove\* Buzzer | D5
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

![](./../../doorbell/images/doorbell-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io) 
1. Node.js 
2. [MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/counter/doorbell/inc",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)


## Running the program

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    $ ./doorbell
    
You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.
    
### IoT cloud setup (opinion)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (opinion)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.
