# Doorbell in C++

## Introduction

This smart doorbell application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse\* IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or Intel® Galileo board.
- Store the doorbell ring data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart doorbell that:

- issues an audible notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- displays a visual notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- keeps track of visitors using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

Naturally, this smart doorbell makes a noise with the buzzer when the I2C Touch Sensor is pressed. In addition, it displays a message on the LCD.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

![](./../../images/cpp/enter-project-name.png)
10. Your project source files will now be available on the on the upper left of your IDE by default.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/project-src-imported.png)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

You need to have a Grove\* Base Shield V2 connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Base Shield V2. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Base Shield V2 set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Touch Sensor, and connect the other end to the D4 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.<br>
![](./../../images/js/doorbell.jpg)
2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove\* Buzzer, and connect the other end to the D5 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.
3. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove\* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Base Shield V2.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../../images/js/doorbell-dfrobot.jpg)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Buzzer, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

2. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Touch Sensor, and connect the other end to the A1 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

### Intel® Edison board setup

This example also uses the **restclient-cpp** library to perform REST calls to the remote data server. The code can be found in the **lib** directory. The **restclient-cpp** library requires the **libcurl** package, which is already installed on the Intel® Edison board by default.

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdks

The Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

### IoT cloud setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.
![](./../../images/cpp/add-name-and-var.png)
5. Your new name symbol and value will now be displayed. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/name-var-ok.png)
6. Another dialog box will appear asking to rebuild project. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/path-symbol-rebuild-ok.png)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board to Intel® System Studio

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)
If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/doorbell;export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/counter/doorbell/inc"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Intel® System Studio.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

When the program uploads and runs on the Intel® Edison board, the Grove\* RGB LCD shows the message above. When pressing the Grove\* Touch Sensor, you hear the buzzer go off, and if your server is set up correctly, you get notified.<br>
