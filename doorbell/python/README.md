# Doorbell in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart doorbell that:
- issues an audible notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- issues a visual notification whenever the doorbell is rung.
- keeps track of visitors using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the [General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Touch Sensor | D4 
Grove\* Buzzer | D5
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\* 

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Buzzer | A1
Touch Sensor | A2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see [Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and [UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the [setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Python\* Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

## Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_doorbell&subdirectory=doorbell/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_doorbell/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_doorbell/doorbell/python/iot_doorbell/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata"
}
```
To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

## Running the program

Once the program is installed and configured as detailed above, you can execute the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_doorbell

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

```

```
    
Refer to [How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.
