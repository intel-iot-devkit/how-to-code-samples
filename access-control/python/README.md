# Access control in Python*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart access control system that:<br>
- monitors a motion sensor to detect when a person is in an area that requires authorization.<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to disable the alarm.<br>
- keeps track of access, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

![](./../../access-control/images/access-control-grove.JPG)

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
PIR Motion Sensor | D4
Grove RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\* 

![](./../../access-control/images/access-control-dfrobot.JPG)

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
PIR (Motion) Sensor | A2

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://upm.mraa.io/) 
2. Python 2.7
3. Packages as listed in the ![setup.py](setup.py) file in this directory
1. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

You can install the dependencies.

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_access_control/access-control/python/iot_access_control/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "CODE": "4321"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `PLATFORM` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "CODE": "4321",
  "PLATFORM": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "CODE": "4321",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

## Running the program

Once the program is installed and configured as detailed above, you can execute the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_access_control

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.
