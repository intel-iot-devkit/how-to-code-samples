# Access control in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel-based platform, this project lets you create a smart access control system that:

- monitors a motion sensor to detect when a person is in an area that requires authorization.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via a built-in web interface to disable the alarm.
- keeps track of access data, using cloud-based storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove or DFRobot sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

PIR Motion Sensor | D4
Grove RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. MRAA https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa and UPM https://upm.mraa.io/
2. Intel® System Studio ![https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c](https://software.intel.com/en-us/creating-iot-projects-with-intel-system-studio-2018-c) 
3. Microsof Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
4. Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code 
  -jsoncpp
  -restclient

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.
![](./../../images/cpp/add-name-and-var.png)
5. Your new name symbol and value will now be displayed. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/name-var-ok.png)
6. Another dialog box will appear asking to rebuild project. Click **OK**.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the output below.<br>

```
MQTT message published: { d: { value: '2016-04-21T23:57:18.254Z looking-for-motion'  }}
2016-04-21T23:57:30.559Z motion-detected 
Connecting to MQTT server... 
MQTT message published: { d: { value: '2016-04-21T23:57:30.559Z motion-detected'  }}
```

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **access-control**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the environment variables so it looks like this, except using the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/access-control; export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

## Regenerating the HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
We have a useful tutorial on how to use the shell script here:
