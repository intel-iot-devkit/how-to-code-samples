# How-to code samples  

These applications are how-to code samples using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and compatible Intel-based platforms, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies. 

## To clone this repository

To begin, clone the **How-To Code Samples** repository with Git\* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

To download a .zip file, in your web browser go to <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples">https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples</a> and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Installing the program manually on the target system

Alternatively, you can set up the code manually on your system.

Clone the **How-To Code Samples** repository to your board:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Navigate to the directory with this example.

# Setup

## Hardware Compatibility

These samples are currently supported by the following platforms:

Intel IoT Gateway using Arduino 101 (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/gateways) 
Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup with an operating system, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

## Software Requirements

### mraa

[mraa.io](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa)

### upm

[upm.io](https://upm.mraa.io/)

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

For Java or C/C++ development, use the Intel System Studio IoT Edition - https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/tools-ide/ide/iss-iot-edition 

For JavaScript development, use the Intel® XDK - https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk

## Configuring the examples

Each example includes a configuration file to setup sensors and other application parameters.

For C++ look in cpp.json  
For Java look in /src/config.properties  
For JavaScript look in config.json  
For Python look in config.py  

Refer to each example for the specific configuration needed.

## Cloud and datastore configuration

Specific instructions on setting up individual cloud services can be found here https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup

Adding a Redis\* datastore can be done by following instructions here https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore
